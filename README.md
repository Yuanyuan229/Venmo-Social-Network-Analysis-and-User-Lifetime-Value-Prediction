# Venmo-Social-Network-Analysis-and-User-Lifetime-Value-Prediction

In this project, we processed 7M+ transaction records with topic modeling and social network analysis to explore user behavior.

By establishing consumption behavior profiles of 1M users with SQL, we predicted customer life value with RFM
model (Recency, frequency, Monetary) and social network characteristics.
